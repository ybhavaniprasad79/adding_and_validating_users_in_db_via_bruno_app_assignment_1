Imagine you are developing an online marketplace where buyers and sellers need to create an account to participate. The platform requires new users to register by providing their username, email, and password. To ensure security, the password must be hashed before storing it in the database. 

- Use mongoose to connect to database.
- Write an backend endpoint that will get the username, mail and password.
- After make sure three of these are no empty.
- Write an mongoose schema to store these three values.
- Use bcrypt package to hash the password.
- Save the data in mongodb.
- send res success.


# **How to Fork and Set Up Your Repository**

---

## **1. Fork the Repository on StackBlitz**

- You will be provided with a **StackBlitz** link for the assignment.
- Open the link in your browser and click on the **Fork** button in StackBlitz.  
  This will create a copy of the repository in your StackBlitz account.

---

## **2. Clone the Repository to Your Personal GitHub**

- After forking, you can download the project or push it directly to your personal GitHub repository:
  - **Option 1: Download and Push**
    1. Download the repository files from StackBlitz.
    2. Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:
       ```bash
       git init
       git remote add origin <your_github_repo_url>
       ```
       Replace `<your_github_repo_url>` with your personal GitHub repository URL.
    3. Commit and push the files to your GitHub repository:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Completed the assignment"
       git push -u origin main
       ```
  - **Option 2: Push Directly**
    1. Use the **Push to GitHub** option in StackBlitz to directly connect and push the repository to your GitHub account.

## **3. Submission Instructions**

- Once your code is successfully pushed to GitHub:
  1. Copy the link to your GitHub repository.
  2. Submit the link on the assignment submission portal.  
     The link should follow this format:  
     **`https://github.com/<your_username>/<repository_name>`**

### **Example Submission**

If your GitHub username is `johnDoe` and the repository name is `assignment-repo`, the submission link would look like this:
